# Used Car Price Predictor

## Overview
The Used Car Price Predictor is an interactive web application designed to estimate the market value of used cars. Using the "Used Car Price Prediction" dataset from Kaggle, this application integrates a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various attributes, offering valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Cleaning and Analysis:** Python, NumPy, and Pandas
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Model:** Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code
- **Web Framework:** Flask for serving HTTP requests
- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Features
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Allows users to input car details (e.g., make, year, mileage) and receive instant price predictions.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Includes data cleaning, outlier detection, feature engineering, and more to ensure model accuracy.
- **Model Training and Validation:** Utilizes linear regression, with techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.

## Dataset
The model was trained on the "Used Car Price Prediction" dataset available on Kaggle. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayaz11/used-car-price-prediction).

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kunalch204/Used-Car-Price-Predictor.git
   
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Start the Flask server
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the web interface.

## Usage
Enter the details about the used car, such as make, year, and mileage, into the web interface. The application will use the trained machine learning model to predict and display the estimated market value.
